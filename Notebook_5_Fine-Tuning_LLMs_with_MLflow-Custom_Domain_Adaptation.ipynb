    "## 1. Why Fine-Tune LLMs? Focus on Domain Adaptation\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning allows us to specialize a general pre-trained LLM for specific tasks or domains. While large models are powerful, fine-tuning can unlock superior performance, style, and knowledge relevant to your unique needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits for Domain Adaptation:**\n",
    "- **Specialized Vocabulary & Nuances:** Teach the model the specific language, jargon, and subtle understanding of a particular field (e.g., generating recipes, medical report summaries, legal document analysis).\n",
    "- **Style & Tone Alignment:** Adapt the model to generate text in a desired voice, tone (formal, casual, enthusiastic), or format (e.g., recipe steps, JSON outputs, poetic verse).\n",
    "- **Improved Task Performance:** Enhance capabilities for tasks where the base model might be too general (e.g., generating highly specific types of creative content or following complex, domain-specific instructions).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, our goal is to adapt `Qwen3-0.6B` to become proficient at generating creative and coherent recipes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT):** Techniques like LoRA drastically reduce the computational resources and memory required for fine-tuning by only updating a small fraction of the model's parameters. This makes fine-tuning accessible even for very large models on consumer-grade hardware.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Base Model: `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B`**\n",
    "We'll be fine-tuning `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B`. This is the latest (as of May 2025) 0.6 billion parameter model in the Qwen3 series from Alibaba. \n",
    "Key features:\n",
    "- **Size:** 0.6B parameters (0.44B non-embedding).\n",
    "- **Architecture:** Causal Language Model, 28 layers, GQA (16 heads for Q, 8 for KV).\n",
    "- **Context Length:** Supports up to 32,768 tokens.\n",
    "- **Training:** Pre-trained and post-trained (instruction/chat tuned).\n",
    "- **Highlights:** Strong reasoning, instruction-following, multilingual support, and agent capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Its relatively small size combined with strong capabilities makes it an excellent candidate for efficient fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset for Fine-Tuning (Recipe Generation):**\n",
    "We will again use the `alignment-handbook/recipe_instructions` dataset. This dataset provides prompt-response pairs for generating recipes, which is ideal for our domain adaptation task. The typical format is `<s>Human: [USER_PROMPT]</s><s>Assistant: [MODEL_RESPONSE]</s>`.\n",
