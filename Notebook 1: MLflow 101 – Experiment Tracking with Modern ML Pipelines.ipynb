This notebook is designed to introduce you to the basics of MLflow, focusing on experiment tracking with a modern machine learning pipeline. We will keep things simple and clear to make sure you get comfortable with MLflow. More exciting and advanced topics will be covered in the upcoming notebooks.\n\n---\n\n## Table of Contents\n1.

In this notebook, we focus on the experiment tracking component, which helps you log and compare your machine learning experiments efficiently.\n\n![MLflow Logo](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/_static/mlflow-logo.png)\n\nKey features of MLflow experiment tracking:\n- Log parameters, metrics, and artifacts\n- Visualize and compare runs\n- Organize experiments and runs\n\nLet's get started!"
