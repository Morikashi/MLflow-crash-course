    "Welcome to the seventh notebook in our MLflow series! We've journeyed through MLflow basics, HPO, model registry, RAG, fine-tuning, and LLM evaluation. Now, we're stepping into the dynamic world of **AI Agents** capable of using tools to interact with their environment and solve complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will:\n",
    "- Introduce **LangGraph**, a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, perfect for creating agentic workflows [1, 2].\n",
    "- Build an agent that can decide which tools to call based on a user's query.\n",
    "- Utilize a locally running LLM (e.g., `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B` or `phi3:mini`) via **Ollama** to power our agent's reasoning [2, 3].\n",
    "- Define custom tools for our agent (e.g., a simple calculator, a mock weather service).\n",
    "- Integrate **MLflow Tracing** to capture and visualize the intricate steps, decisions, and tool invocations within our LangGraph agent [1, 4].\n",

    "\n",
    "An **AI Agent** is a system that can perceive its environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. In the context of LLMs, agents often leverage the language understanding and reasoning capabilities of an LLM to:\n",
    "- **Understand User Intent:** Interpret complex requests or queries.\n",
    "- **Plan Steps:** Break down a problem into smaller, manageable tasks.\n",
    "- **Use Tools:** Interact with external systems, APIs, or functions to gather information or perform actions that the LLM itself cannot (e.g., browse the web, access a database, perform calculations, call a specific API).\n",
    "- **Maintain State/Memory:** Keep track of past interactions and information to inform future decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tool use** is a cornerstone of modern LLM-based agents. By giving an LLM access to tools, we extend its capabilities far beyond text generation, allowing it to ground its responses in real-world data or perform concrete actions.\n",

    "## 2. What is LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "**LangGraph** is a library built by LangChain for creating stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs [1, 2]. It allows you to build agentic systems as **graphs**, where nodes represent computation steps (e.g., calling an LLM, executing a tool) and edges define the flow of execution, including conditional logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "![MLFlow logo](https://www.the-odd-dataguy.com/images/posts/20191113/cover.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Concepts in LangGraph [2, 5]:**\n",
    "- **State Graph (`StateGraph`):** The core a LangGraph application. It's a directed graph where nodes operate on a shared `AgentState` object.\n",
    "- **Agent State (`TypedDict`):** A dictionary-like object that holds the current state of the agent (e.g., input query, chat history, intermediate steps, tool calls, tool outputs). This state is passed between nodes and updated by them.\n",
    "- **Nodes:** Python functions or callables that represent a unit of work. Each node receives the current agent state and returns an update to the state.\n",
    "- **Edges:** Define the flow of control between nodes. \n",
    "    - **Standard Edges:** Always transition from one node to another.\n",
    "    - **Conditional Edges:** Route the execution to different nodes based on the current agent state (e.g., if an LLM decided to call a tool, go to the tool execution node; otherwise, go to the response generation node).\n",
    "- **Entry and Finish Points:** Define where the graph execution starts and ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why LangGraph? [2, 5]**\n",
    "- **Control & Flexibility:** Offers a lower-level, more explicit way to define agent logic compared to some higher-level agent frameworks.\n",
    "- **State Management:** Explicitly manages state throughout the agent's execution flow.\n",
    "- **Cyclical Computations:** Easily create loops, allowing agents to iteratively refine answers or call tools multiple times.\n",
    "- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Can be designed to pause and wait for human input at any step.\n",
    "- **Parallelism:** LangGraph supports running tool nodes concurrently, which can speed up execution when multiple independent tools need to be called [5].\n",

    "## 8. Key Takeaways for Building and Tracing Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduced you to the powerful combination of LangGraph, Ollama, and MLflow for building and observing tool-calling agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LangGraph for Agent Logic:** Provides a flexible, graph-based approach to define complex agent behaviors, state management, and conditional tool use [2, 5].\n",
    "- **Local LLMs with Ollama:** Enables development and experimentation with powerful open-source LLMs running entirely on your local machine, enhancing privacy and reducing reliance on cloud APIs [3].\n",
    "- **Tool Definition:** Custom tools extend the agent's capabilities beyond the LLM's inherent knowledge.\n",
    "- **MLflow for Agent Tracing:** `mlflow.langchain.autolog()` is invaluable for capturing the detailed execution flow of LangGraph agents, including LLM decisions, tool inputs/outputs, and the overall state evolution [1]. This is crucial for debugging, understanding, and improving agent performance.\n",
    "- **Iterative Development:** The ability to trace and inspect agent behavior allows for rapid iteration and refinement of prompts, tool definitions, and agent logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building robust agents often involves careful prompt engineering to guide the LLM in tool selection and response generation, as well as thoughtful tool design.\n",
